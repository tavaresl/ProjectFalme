# You Can't Really Tame Monsters (You Can Try, Though)

> Made for GMTK Jam 2020.

Fitting the theme of "Out of Control" you can't control the actions of your team of monsters, only suggest a course of action, which they'll follow, or not, based on their personalities.

Also, when trying to play again, the game might just decide you've had enough, and quit. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
